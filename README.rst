Open LaTeX documents with this program in a new terminal window. It will start
gVim with the ``.tex`` file and let ``latexmk`` run ``pdflatex`` every time you
save the document in the editor. The PDF will be displayed and should be
reloaded after rendering.

This gives you a kind of IDE for LaTeX, while you can still use Vim as your
editor.
